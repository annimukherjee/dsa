## DSA

I will be documenting my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms here. I will be using C++ / Python / Java for this purpose.

I am trying to follow [Striver's A2Z DSA Course/Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2). It's extremely organised, starts from the fundamentals and goes on to advanced topics. I will be following this course and also supplementing it with other resources like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

I hope to make a commit everyday as I learn one new thing everyday. I will be taking notes in Markdown and also include C++ files where necessary.

I hope that this *public contract* will keep me accountable and help me stay consistent in my learning.

## Things I've Learnt:

1. In Pandas, to modify the columns `.astype('int')` or something is used in general.
2. In Pandas, to rename a column, you have to pass a dictionary of the `{'old_col_name': 'new_col_name'}` to the `.rename()` function.
3. In SQL, to use the WHERE clause these two links might be helpful to refresh your memory of the Syntax ([here](https://five.co/blog/sql-multiple-where-clauses/#:~:text=%27New%20York%27%3B-,Combining%20Multiple%20WHERE%20Clauses,Using%20OR%20operator), [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp))
4. If you want to get the unique values from a column in SQL use the `DISTINCT` keyword. For example, `SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;` ([here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_distinct.asp))
