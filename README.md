## DSA

I will be documenting my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms here. I will be using C++ / Python / Java for this purpose.

I am trying to follow [Striver's A2Z DSA Course/Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2). It's extremely organised, starts from the fundamentals and goes on to advanced topics. I will be following this course and also supplementing it with other resources like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

I hope to make a commit everyday as I learn one new thing everyday. I will be taking notes in Markdown and also include C++ files where necessary.

I hope that this *public contract* will keep me accountable and help me stay consistent in my learning.

    1. Did a running sum of the array.
 27. https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/ (15 Apr 2025)
     1.  Did this in O(n) time. Problem is to find the square root of a number without using built in functions. Can do this with binary search and thus reduce the problem into `O(log(n))`
 28. https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-data-concatenate/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=introduction-to-pandas&lang=pythondata (16 April)
     1.  Essentially teaches you how to use the `pd.concat()` function. `concat()` allows you to glue dataframes together. If `axis=0` it does a row wise concatenation (increase the height of the dataframe) and if `axis=1`, it does a column wise concatenation (increase the width of the dataframe). Also supports `join` etc. i.e. `inner` and `outer`. [Great short medium article here](https://medium.com/@connor.m.killion/joins-concat-vs-merge-inner-vs-outer-with-pandas-b27d36b63752).
 29. https://leetcode.com/problems/method-chaining/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=introduction-to-pandas&lang=pythondata
     1.  Method Chaining. Filter, sort the df by weight using `sort_values(by='col_name')` and then get the necessary column.
 30. https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=prshgx6i
     1.  Take an integer, add all the digits of that integer to get a number. If that number has more than one digit, repeat.
     2.  I created a modular solution whereby I created a function whose purpose was to input a number and output the sum of the digits of that number. Then I ran a while loop until the num//10 == 0 as that would mean that `num` is a number with one digit.
 31. https://leetcode.com/problems/score-of-a-string/submissions/1643047539/
     1.  Given a string, calculate the difference of the ASCII values of adjacent characters
     2.  Use `ord` to get the ASCII value of a character in Python
     3.  To get the absolute value of any number, use `abs()` instead of `math.abs()`.
 32. https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/description/
     1.  Return the max of the row wise sum of a mxn matrix
 33. https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/
     1.  Given two strings `s1 = "abc"` and `s2 = "pqr"`, merge them alternatively i.e. `"apbqcr"`
        - To solve:
          - Check which word has the least length
          - Run a for loop and add the characters till that least length i.e. do `merged_str = merged_str + word1[i] + word2[i]`
          - Then for the string that's longer (if that's even a case), add all the characters from len(shorter_str) to len(longer_word). Checkout my solution here for better context.

    1.  Classic FizzBuzz. Need I say more?



### CodeForces:

   1. Essentially check if a number is even and greater than 2 so that it can be split into two even numbers. 
2. https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/71/A [Way Too Long Words]
   1. Essentially get the length of a string and if the length of the string is more than 10 then replace it with 
3. https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/231/A [Team]
   1. Count the number of 1's in a bit string. Count if it's more than 2.
4. https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/282/A [Bit++]
   1. See if the string '++' is in the string and update a variable accordingly.






## Things I've Learnt:

1. In Pandas, to modify the columns `.astype('int')` or something is used in general.
2. In Pandas, to rename a column, you have to pass a dictionary of the `{'old_col_name': 'new_col_name'}` to the `.rename()` function.
3. In SQL, to use the WHERE clause these two links might be helpful to refresh your memory of the Syntax ([here](https://five.co/blog/sql-multiple-where-clauses/#:~:text=%27New%20York%27%3B-,Combining%20Multiple%20WHERE%20Clauses,Using%20OR%20operator), [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp))
4. If you want to get the unique values from a column in SQL use the `DISTINCT` keyword. For example, `SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;` ([here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_distinct.asp))
5. To read numbers in Bash you use `read` command. For example, `read a` will read a number and store it in the variable `a`.
6. To do arithmetic expressions in Bash using the values of variables use the `$(())` sign. For example, `echo $((a+b))` will print the sum of `a` and `b`.
7. In Pandas if you have a column say `email` in a DataFrame, say, `customers` and you want to get the drop the rows where a duplicate value occurs then use `customers.drop_duplicates(subset=['email'])`. This will drop the rows where the `email` column has duplicate values. ([Nice article](https://medium.com/@robertsevan/leetcode-problem-2882-drop-duplicate-rows-leetcode-introduction-to-pandas-70e8a5298e40))
8. `sorted()` in Python returns a list whereas `.sort()` just does the sort inplace on the list. So, `a=sorted(list)` makes sense but `b=l.sort()` will yield `None` for `b`.
