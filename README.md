## DSA

I will be documenting my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms here. I will be using C++ / Python / Java for this purpose.

I am trying to follow [Striver's A2Z DSA Course/Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2). It's extremely organised, starts from the fundamentals and goes on to advanced topics. I will be following this course and also supplementing it with other resources like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

I hope to make a commit everyday as I learn one new thing everyday. I will be taking notes in Markdown and also include C++ files where necessary.

I hope that this *public contract* will keep me accountable and help me stay consistent in my learning.

    1. Did a running sum of the array.
 27. https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/ (15 Apr 2025)
     1.  Did this in O(n) time. Problem is to find the square root of a number without using built in functions. Can do this with binary search and thus reduce the problem into `O(log(n))`
 28. https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-data-concatenate/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=introduction-to-pandas&lang=pythondata (16 April)
     1.  Essentially teaches you how to use the `pd.concat()` function. `concat()` allows you to glue dataframes together. If `axis=0` it does a row wise concatenation (increase the height of the dataframe) and if `axis=1` (increase the width of the dataframe) it does a column wise concatenation. Also supports `join` etc. i.e. `inner` and `outer`. [Great short medium article here](https://medium.com/@connor.m.killion/joins-concat-vs-merge-inner-vs-outer-with-pandas-b27d36b63752).
 29. https://leetcode.com/problems/method-chaining/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=introduction-to-pandas&lang=pythondata
     1.  Method Chaining. Filter, sort the df by weight using `sort_values(by='col_name')` and then get the necessary column.



### CodeForces:

   1. Essentially get the length of a string and if the length of the string is more than 10 then replace it with 
3. https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/231/A [Team]
   1. Count the number of 1's in a bit string. Count if it's more than 2.
4. https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/282/A [Bit++]
   1. See if the string '++' is in the string and update a variable accordingly.

Thinking of using this Roadmap: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mohammadfraz_dsa-will-be-hard-for-you-until-your-basics-activity-7314269799121833984-Qiv2?utm_medium=ios_app&rcm=ACoAAD36RO8BJuUVKHrrxCH5luy7TsWec1SoVKo&utm_source=social_share_send&utm_campaign=copy_link

## Things I've Learnt:

1. In Pandas, to modify the columns `.astype('int')` or something is used in general.
2. In Pandas, to rename a column, you have to pass a dictionary of the `{'old_col_name': 'new_col_name'}` to the `.rename()` function.
3. In SQL, to use the WHERE clause these two links might be helpful to refresh your memory of the Syntax ([here](https://five.co/blog/sql-multiple-where-clauses/#:~:text=%27New%20York%27%3B-,Combining%20Multiple%20WHERE%20Clauses,Using%20OR%20operator), [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp))
4. If you want to get the unique values from a column in SQL use the `DISTINCT` keyword. For example, `SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;` ([here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_distinct.asp))
5. To read numbers in Bash you use `read` command. For example, `read a` will read a number and store it in the variable `a`.
6. To do arithmetic expressions in Bash using the values of variables use the `$(())` sign. For example, `echo $((a+b))` will print the sum of `a` and `b`.
7. In Pandas if you have a column say `email` in a DataFrame, say, `customers` and you want to get the drop the rows where a duplicate value occurs then use `customers.drop_duplicates(subset=['email'])`. This will drop the rows where the `email` column has duplicate values.
