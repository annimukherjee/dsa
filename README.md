## DSA

I will be documenting my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms here. I will be using C++ for this purpose.

I am following the a course by Striver called [Strivers A2Z DSA Course/Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2). It's extremely organised, starts from the fundamentals and goes on to advanced topics. I will be following this course and also supplementing it with other resources like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

I hope to make a commit everyday as I learn one new thing everyday. I will be taking notes in Markdown and also include C++ files where necessary.

I hope that this *public contract* will keep me accountable and help me stay consistent in my learning.
